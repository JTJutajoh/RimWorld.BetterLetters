## Features

- Snoozing letters
- Setting custom reminders for specific in-game dates and times
- Custom icons for various types of Letters like quests, deaths, and more
- Custom status icons for letters such as quest status
- Letters for expired quests change to "Quest Expired"
- Snooze letters with an expiration (like quest offers) until 1 day or 1 hour before they expire
- Raid letters include more details about the raid (like if they will attack immediately, # of groups, and more)
- Disable bouncing/flashing for letters (only pinned letters by default)
- Button to bulk to dismiss all letters with multiple filtering options
- Filters in the History tab to show/hide reminders and snoozed letters
- **Highly configurable!** Check mod settings

- **Safe to add/remove in an ongoing save**
- **Made for RimWorld 1.6 and 1.5**
- Supports RimWorld 1.2-1.4 as well, some features may not be available on older versions
- Mods that add custom types of letters will not use any of the icons from this mod, in most cases, without a patch
- UI mods that alter the way Letters are drawn might conflict. Please let me know if you discover any such incompatibilities.
