# BetterLetters
Quality of Life UI mod designed to make it easier to keep track of Letters (notifications).
  
Makes the normal "Close" or "Jump to Location" choices (And some others) not remove the Letter. Letters can still be removed by right clicking them.
Adds a new Dismiss choice that does remove the letter.
